-- Prevent Duplicate POP Uploads Migration
-- ============================================================================
-- Created: 2026-01-07
-- Purpose: Prevent parents from uploading multiple POPs for the same month
-- ============================================================================

-- Add unique index to prevent duplicate POPs for the same student in the same month
-- Only applies when status is 'pending' or 'approved' (rejected POPs can be re-uploaded)
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_pop_uploads_unique_month 
ON pop_uploads (
  student_id, 
  DATE_TRUNC('month', payment_date)
)
WHERE status IN ('pending', 'approved');
-- Add helpful comment
COMMENT ON INDEX idx_pop_uploads_unique_month IS 
'Prevents duplicate POP uploads for the same student in the same month when status is pending or approved. Rejected POPs can be re-uploaded.';
-- Add function to check for duplicates before insert (additional safety)
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION check_duplicate_pop_upload()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
