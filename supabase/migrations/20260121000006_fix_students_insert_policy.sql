-- Migration: Fix students INSERT policy for principals
-- Issue: students_principal_access policy has USING clause but no WITH CHECK clause
-- For INSERT operations, WITH CHECK is required to validate the new row data

-- Drop and recreate the students_principal_access policy with proper WITH CHECK
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS students_principal_access ON students;
CREATE POLICY students_principal_access ON students
