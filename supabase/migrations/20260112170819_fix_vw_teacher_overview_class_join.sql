-- Fix vw_teacher_overview to correctly join classes with teachers
-- Issue: The view was joining classes.teacher_id with public.users.id,
--        but classes.teacher_id actually stores auth.users.id
-- Fix: Join directly with teachers.user_id (which stores auth.users.id)

COMMENT ON VIEW vw_teacher_overview IS 
'Teacher overview with class and student counts. Uses RLS via current_preschool_id(). 
Fixed on 2026-01-12: Changed join from public.users to teachers.user_id for correct class matching.';
