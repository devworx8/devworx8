-- Migration: Fix video_calls and students FK queries
-- Date: 2026-01-22
-- 
-- Issues addressed:
-- 1. 500 error on video_calls query with teacher:teacher_id join
-- 2. 400 error on students query with profiles!students_parent_id_fkey join
--
-- Root causes:
-- - Missing or incorrect RLS policies for parent users
-- - FK relationships not properly configured for PostgREST joins
