-- =============================================================================
-- Fix job_postings RLS: prevent anon/public reads from evaluating principal-only
-- policies that reference private tables (users/profiles).
--
-- Symptom (web):
-- - GET /rest/v1/job_postings ... returns 401 with messages like:
--   - "permission denied for table users"
--   - "infinite recursion detected in policy for relation \"profiles\""
--
-- Root cause:
-- - Legacy job_postings principal policies were created with TO public, so they
--   apply to anon as well. Their USING clauses reference tables that anon
--   cannot read, causing the entire SELECT to error even though a public
--   "active postings" policy exists.
--
-- Fix:
-- - Keep a dedicated public policy for active, non-expired postings (anon + authenticated)
-- - Scope principal/admin manage policies to authenticated only
-- - Use SECURITY DEFINER helper functions to avoid direct table access in RLS expressions
