-- Fix students table RLS policies
-- Multiple policies incorrectly use profiles.id = auth.uid() 
-- but it should be profiles.auth_user_id = auth.uid()
-- auth.uid() returns the authenticated user's UUID from auth.users table
-- which matches auth_user_id in profiles, NOT the profile's id column

-- Drop the broken policies
