-- Migration: Fix students RLS infinite recursion
-- Problem: Multiple students RLS policies were causing infinite recursion when evaluated
-- Root cause: Policies used functions that queried profiles table, which has RLS that uses
--            functions that query profiles again, causing an infinite loop
-- Solution: Simplified policies to use direct subqueries that don't chain through functions

-- ============================================================================
-- 1. Drop problematic duplicate function in app schema
-- ============================================================================
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS app.current_preschool_id() CASCADE;
-- ============================================================================
-- 2. Recreate current_preschool_id with proper SECURITY DEFINER
-- ============================================================================
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.current_preschool_id()
RETURNS uuid
LANGUAGE plpgsql
STABLE
SECURITY DEFINER
SET search_path = 'public', 'extensions', 'auth'
AS $$
DECLARE

  result_uuid UUID;
BEGIN
  -- First check if user is authenticated
  IF auth.uid() IS NULL THEN
    RETURN NULL;
  END IF;

  -- Try to get preschool_id from JWT claims first (fastest)
  preschool_id_claim := auth.jwt() ->> 'preschool_id';

-- 3. Drop all old students policies that caused recursion
-- ============================================================================
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS parents_view_school_students ON students;

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS students_parent_insert_own_children ON students;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS students_parent_update_own_children ON students;
