-- Migration: Fix duplicate foreign key on assignment_submissions table
-- The table has both assignment_id and homework_assignment_id pointing to homework_assignments
-- This causes HTTP 300 "Multiple Choices" errors in PostgREST queries
-- 
-- This migration removes the redundant homework_assignment_id column and its FK

-- First, check if any data uses homework_assignment_id that doesn't match assignment_id
-- If there's mismatched data, we need to handle it
