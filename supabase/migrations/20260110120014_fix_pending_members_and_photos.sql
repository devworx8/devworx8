-- Fix pending members and profile picture loading issues
-- This migration addresses:
-- 1. Activate pending members who registered via web
-- 2. Sync profile avatars to organization_members.photo_url
-- 3. Create functions to manage member status

BEGIN;
-- ========================================
-- 1. ACTIVATE PENDING MEMBERS
-- ========================================
-- Members who registered via web have membership_status='pending'
-- but their seat_status is 'active'. Let's activate their membership.

UPDATE organization_members

  AND membership_status = 'pending'
  AND seat_status = 'active'
  AND join_date IS NOT NULL;
-- ========================================
-- 2. FIX PROFILE PICTURE SYNC
-- ========================================
-- The ID cards look for `organization_members.photo_url`
-- but avatars are stored in `profiles.avatar_url`
-- Let's sync them

UPDATE organization_members om
SET photo_url = p.avatar_url,
    updated_at = NOW()
